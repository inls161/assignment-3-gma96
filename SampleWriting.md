# This Class So Far

This is my reflection write-up from assignment 2 with a few changes so
that it meets the requirements of assignment 3.

Here is a quote. It's a movie quote that has nothing to do with the contents
of this write-up, but it's here because the assignment requires quotes.

"Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times, when one only remembers to turn on the light." -Dumbledore, 
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

Now here is some text formatting. There can be **bold text**, or there
can be *italics text*. All of these are for emphasis.

And finally, here is the reflection from assignment 2 with a table
added.

It’s been a little over a month since I’ve started my sophomore year at
UNC and enrolled in this class called INLS 161. A month may seem like a
short amount of time, but a lot can be learned in a small time frame.
Here is a summary of what I’ve learned so far.

I’m a computer science major, and I’ve heard about github and have even
downloaded files from the site in my past classes, but I never really
knew exactly what it was or what you could do with it. This class has
expanded my knowledge about github and has allowed me to gain experience
with using the website. This class has also given me an introduction to
linux and linux commands. Coincidentally, I’m also learning and using
linux commands in another class that I am taking this semester, so it’s
helpful that the things I’m learning in this class are also helping me
in other classes and might also potentially be useful in my future
career in computer science.

Here are some basic commonly-used linux commands that I’ve learned in
this class.

| Command | Action                      |
|---------|-----------------------------|
| cd      | changes directory           |
| pwd     | prints working directory    |
| ls      | lists contents of directory |

For more information on linux, [this
resource](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php) provides a
great overview of different commands.

Moreover, I’ve learned the basics of creating and editing websites using
html, css, and markdown and how to display websites on github. I’ve
learned about customizing the way a website looks, like editing colors,
fonts, and text sizes, and I’ve learned about adding different types of
data to a website, like adding pictures, embedding videos, sounds, or
widgets, and adding snippets of code. It’s a likely possibility that I
might have to create or work with websites in my future career, so it’s
good that I’m learning these useful skills.

Overall, I think the things I’ve learned in this class so far and the
things that I’m going to learn in this class later in the semester are
helpful skills and will allow me to succeed in other classes and in the
future.
